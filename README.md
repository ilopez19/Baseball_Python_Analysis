##Data Analysis Project: Age Impact on Baseball Performance

Objective: Investigated how age affects player performance (batting, pitching, salary) using statistical modeling and predictive analytics.
Data Processing: Cleaned and merged baseball datasets (player stats, salaries, demographics) in R and PySpark, handling missing values.
Analysis: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and linear regression (70/30 train-test split) to evaluate ageâ€™s impact on key metrics (RBI, ERA, salary).
Findings:
Performance peaks in late 20s/early 30s, then declines (bell-curve trend).
Salary trends were irregular, with spikes near retirement due to contract structures.
Linear models showed low predictive accuracy, suggesting non-linear models (e.g., polynomial regression) for better results.
